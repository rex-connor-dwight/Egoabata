                <p>
                    Good Morning, Head teacher, Teachers and fellow students <br>
               <br> My Name is Egoabata Banor
                I am honored to be nominated as a candidate for the position of                 Head Girl and want to say I am grateful for this great opportunity              to serve you all.
                I would like to start with a quote by an old famous American                business man Ray Kroc and he said that the quality of a leader is           reflected in the standards they set for themselves. <br>
                Over the years with the help of my parents and teachers I have              been able to possess certain leadership qualities that helped set               solid standard for myself and these qualities are:
                Integrity
                communication
                Courage
                Empathy and Gratitude 
                I believe that a Head Girl should be a role model, someone the              junior students will look up to in terms of morals, someone who             inspires others to achieve their goals, and a bridge between the            student body and administration and with these few qualities            mentioned and my passion for excellence and my ability to connect          with people from all walks of life, I am confident that I can           fulfill these responsibilities and even much more.
                Genesis School: if you read about us on the website, you will see               clearly where it states that Genesis school students are            encouraged to be citizens of the world, cultivate respect for           cultural diversity, and acquire a sense of global responsibility.
                If elected as a Head girl, I will create platforms in school and                online where every student will have access to information’s that           will help us acquire certain knowledge and skills in this 21st              century that will make us citizens of the world, help us cultivate          respect for culture and diversity and in the end help us acquire         sense of global responsibility.

                IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES:
                School policies are set of rules and guidelines that the school                 imposes that student must follow. These rules or policies are               designed to assist teachers in behavior management and ensure               there is a positive environment for learning where all student          feel comfortable and safe.
                With the help of my cabinet, I will make sure that when ever we                 are engaged to enforce this policies as senior student, we will be              prudent, humble, gentle and respectful and my administration will               not encourage any form of bully so be rest assured that every           students will be treated with so much affection and respect.
                As Head Girl, I will work tirelessly to foster a positive and               inclusive school environment where every student feels safe,            valued, respected, and supported. I will promote academic           excellence, leadership, and personal growth among our student body          by creating and facilitating opportunities for learning,          networking, and engagement.
                Moreover, I will work with the administration and faculty to                ensure that our school's resources and facilities are fully             utilized to enhance the learning experience for all students. I             will listen to your concerns and suggestions, and I will work       collaboratively with my team to address them and create a positive           change that benefits the entire school community.
                In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your attention and                 your consideration. If elected as your Head Girl, I will be                 committed to serving the best interests of our school and its               students, and I will do everything in my power to make our school               an even better place for learning and growth. I humbly ask for          your support and vote in this election. Thank you.
